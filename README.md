_**TASK- CRACK LEAKED PASSWORD DATABASE**_
---

*Respected Sir/Ma’am,*

I have tried to crack the passwords from the leaked hashes given to me. It is to inform you that after analyzing the results, I have pointed out a number of irregularities and flaws in the organisation’s password policy and listed some solutions and steps to overcome these challenges.

The passwords I found did not take a considerable amount of time. 13 out of the 19 given passwords was immediately cracked using Dictionary attack. And after an hour or so, the other 6 hashes were also cracked using Combinator and Masking attack using Hashcat.

The passwords which are leaked, were using MD5 hash algorithm. Though MD5 is widely used but it is considerably much weaker because it is prone to hash collision i.e., it is possible to create the same hash function for two different inputs. 

I consider the use of MD5 as Below Average. I would recommend the usage of SHA-256 algorithm which is much more secure than that of MD5 algorithm and no collision has been recorded till today for the SHA-256. Though MD5 is faster in comparison but security must be the first priority. 

The organisation’s privacy policy is not up to the mark. I have listed below some observations-
•	The minimum length of passwords is 6 and maximum length is 9 for the given. 
•	There are no measures to mandatory usage of at least 1 special characters, 1 number, and letters to make the passwords strong. 
•	There are no restrictions to using the usernames as a part of their respective passwords which makes the passwords vulnerable.
For the organisation to prevent their private data from being vulnerable, they should follow the below listed points. These will make the passwords hard to crack.
•	A strong password must be minimum 8-10 characters long.
•	A strong password should contain different types of characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and characters.
•	They should discourage or prevent user to include any personal details while forming the password — specifically name, username, company name, DOB, etc.
•	The organisation must keep notifying the user to change his/her password after a specific amount of time. Previous NIST guidelines recommended forcing users to change passwords every 90 days.
•	It should not contain any word spelled completely.
•	It’s wise to discourage or prohibit the passwords which are easy to guess (like ‘password’), a string of numbers or letters (like ‘123456’), characters appearing adjacent to each other in the keyboard (like ‘@#$%^&*’), default or suggested passwords from any place, even if they seem strong.

Hope this information will help in the growth of the organisation. Thanking you.
